            <h2>The addiction</h2>
            <img id="image5" src="assets/images/addiction-bet-betting-5258.jpg" alt="Picture of Slot Machines">
            <p>Gambling addiction is an issue that has affected millions of people from all walks of life, destroying their home lives and even proving deadly in some cases. Gambling finds its roots as a form of competition, and it could be this form of competition that causes the aggression associated with gambling addiction. Addicts get a sort of ruch of excitement out of gambling, and it is this rush that causes them to continue to gable, even if they have nothing left to wager, the stakes of the competition and the excitement of the randomness of it all is an addiction that the addict can't quite get from anything else. They develop an obsession, and will lash out and become aggressive when people try to intervene. the addict will try to find a way to make a bet or stakes at any time, and anywhere. </p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>Today, many people are aware of the dangers of gambling and tend to be cautious around casinos and airport slot machines, but what about in Video games? could people as young as children be developing gambling addictions from video games? how is this possible? how can games cause gambling addictions? This is exactly what I'm trying to find out. In Video games gambling is anctivity that players engage in, often at times without even knowing. for example, when a player opens a loot box, the player is in effect opening a container for a random chance to get something good, which nearly by definition, is a form of gambling. one of the most famous examples in gaming is the mystery box from the call of duty franchise. In the game when player play the zombies game mode, they have the opportunity to use the points they earn killing zombies on the mystery box. this chest, after players put points in, gives a random weapon to players. this weapon can either be better or worse than the players current weapon, and is essentially a gamble on what you can get. Another more obvious form of game gambling are the large amounts of mobile and online slot machines, poker games, and blackjack games. Several of these apps have online betting where players can gamble real money like they would from a casino, right from their phone or computer.

            <h2>The Risk</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, gambling addiction is a serious issue that affects many people. it is a serious problem and needs to be treated profesiionally, much like any other form of addiction. This is why it is imperative that something be done to prevent children from having access to any forms of gambling, as thi can lead them down a path to addiction.</p>
