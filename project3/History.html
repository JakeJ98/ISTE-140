            <h1>Video-Games and Gambling</h1>

            <p>Throughout the history of gaming the ideas of sporting competition and gambling have always been present. Even in the early days of games like Pong, or Pac-Man, there was always a sense of competition. Normally a healthy sense of competition is a good thing, and it benfetis both the players and the companies alike. Today though, companies have begun to realize they can use that sense of competition that players feel by encouraging them to gamble thier money in exchange for a leg up on the competition. By manipulating players in this way, game companies are essentially encouraging gambling.</p>
            <p>Usually, when people imagine gambling, they picture an extravagent las vegas casino, the stakes high and the tension growing as people pour out their fortunes in the hopes they get lucky. This may be true in some cases, but gambling doesn't have to so extravagent, it could be as simple as sitting on your couch and playing a game, and most people don't even realize it. Online poker and blackjack games and apps are very active today, and people can often make real money using these services, meaning that people have the ability to gamble at any time and anywhere, all on their phones. The major concern however is on line games and their item gambling systems, and how people can get addicted. This is especially concerning for children considering how often they are playing these games, and how we might be unintentionally allowing kids to become heavy gamblers. there have been several documented cases where all over the world kids as young as 10 years old have lost hundreds of dollars betting and gambling away in game items from games like League of Legends and Counter Stroke: Global Offensive. Below is a video documenting how specifically the rise of micro-transactions came to be, how they affect players, and what the are now.</p>

            <h2>The rise of Micro-Transactions</h2>
            <p> While I speak of micro-transactions like they have always been around, the truth is that micro-transactions are still relatively new in terms of the gaming world, and they actually existed outside of gaming first. in the beginning, micro-transactions began in the late 1990's, and were created when people would use the phone to make purchases or get a phone number from th operator. The small fees these actions would incur were the basis of micro-transactions. As the years went on, micro-transactions made their first waves in gaming through mobile games as cell-phones became more advanced. for small payments, people could pay for advantages in their game, such as extra lives, better items, and in game currency. Seeing how much more profitable these charges were, they became standar for nearly all mobile games, and had already begun seeping their way into desktop and console gaming. They are nearly everywhere today, and especially prevalent in Free-To-Play games, which are games in which have no cost to download and play. Instead, FTP games make their money by offering premium items and boosts to players willing to spend their money.

            <h2>Loot-boxes and P2W</h2>
            <img id="image6" src="assets/images/action-blur-close-up-735911.jpg" alt="close up keyboard image">
            <p>Loot boxes are a relatively recent phenomena that has take over the gaming industry. The gist of it is that a loot box appears as a container in the game holding either one or several random items in it that players may reiceve by opening it. These loot boxes can sometimes ve earned through the completion of challenges, but most often are required to be purchased, and sometimes still the box may be earned in the game, but requires a digital 'key' that players must purchase to oopen said loot box. Often the opening of a loot box is inherintly designed to entice the players, from the visuals of the items appearing to the sound and music design as a player open the box. Developers strive to make the experience as appealing as possible, so that players will be more likely to repeat the action and buy more loot boxes. While loot boxes are still relatively new, there has been much controversy surrounding wheter they should be considered gambling, as players often pour in large sums of money in the hopes that one such container will have the item or skin that player was looking for.Currently according to the ESRB, loot boxes are not considered gambling, but this still may be subject to change.</p>

            <p>Another phenomena that has taken the gaming world by storn is the term "Pay To Win" or P2W. This phrase is used to describe a particular game in which players who put real mone into the game maintain an often obvious and unfair advantage over those who hoose to abstain from paying money. This is often seen in FTP games, and can even sometimes occur in paid titles as well, such as Star Wars Battlefront 2, discussed in the Scandals section of the site, <a href="Scandals.html">here.</a> As is often the case, when players realize this unfair advantage, they usually call upo the developers to make the proper changes to make the game balanced, but sadly, this does not always work. It is unfortunate, but sometimes the developers simply don't care enough about the community and would rather continue to make money.</p>
