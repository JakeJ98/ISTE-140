            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>In the past 20 years, video gaming has become a multi-billion dollar booming industry around the world. One major key to the incredible success of the industry is due to its marketing towards arguably the most profitable dempgraphic: children. Around ninety-seven percent of kids in the United States play video games, and they are arguably the largest source of income for most game companies. Now this begs the question, how are these companies making so much money? the answer may just lie in the sorts of tactics they use in their games in order to generate more income. The most popular amoung them are microtransactions and lootboxes. This provides major questions, such as is this legal? Doesn't this promote gambling for children? how is this affecting minors? Where did this practice begin? It is my mission to answer all these questions and more as you continue to navigate my website.

            <h2>What are Micro-transactions?</h2>
            <p> A micro-transaction is a payment of real money, usually relatively small amounts, that provide a user with bonus content in a game. This bonus content can come in the form of cosmetic items, boosters, and yes, loot boxes. Now i know what you are thinking, "Wait so a player can put money into a game in order to get an advantage? Isn't that just cheating?" No, it is perfectly okay and even encouraged by some companies. In fact, it is actually a very common practice in most online multiplayer games, particularly games like World of Warcraft. Players can fork over their hard earned cash for in game currencies, with names such as "jewels," "platinum," and "gold." Using these digital currencies, players now have access to a wide array of items they didn't have before. Want a new mount for your avatar? you got it! Want a larger inventory? Purchase an expansion slot! Want that super rare sword item? roll the dice and put your in game currency into a loot box for a chance it might be there! "Now wait a second!" I can here some people cry, "these games have gambling in them?" Yes, they do indeed, and its pretty ingenious how they do it.

            <h2>Loot Boxes and other forms of Gambling</h2>
            <p>The Loot box system is an incredibly simple but effective moneymaking strategy that many companies use. the basic idea is that a "loot box" or "crate" is a mysterious container holding various amonts of items available to players. these can be simple cosmetics items that change the appearance of things, or could be things such as special rare weapons and even in-game currency. Each container holds a random "pool" of items the player could possibly obtain, and after opening the box, the player randomly recieves one of those items shown. the more rare the item, the less likely the chances are that the player receives it. Much like a game of blackjack or Poker, players put their money on the line in the hopes of getting something valuable. </p>
